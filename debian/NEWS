minetest (5.5.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt4+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Minetest has now switched to their own fork of the Irrlicht game engine.
  There are significant changes compared to upstream so be aware of
  possible compatibility issues with support tools compiled with upstream
  Irrlicht.

  Maps are now compressed using zstd. Worlds opened or created in Minetest
  5.5.0 will be migrated to this new format and will *no longer* be loadable in
  previous versions of Minetest.
